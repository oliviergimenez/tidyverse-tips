## Motivation

Below is a list of tips and tricks I have gathered from David Robinson's screencasts, which I use for my own `R` peregrinations. Hopefully, these tips will be useful to others.

It took me some time to fully transition from base `R` to the `Tidyverse`. I really clicked when I started watching screencasts by [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) on his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/featured). 

Each week, he goes live for an hour or so, and does exploratory analyses in `R` with data he has never seen before (!). The data comes from the [#TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) from the [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/). This is an awesome initiative, check out the [beautiful data visualisation on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday). 
David Robinson shares [the #RStats code that he writes during his screencasts](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts), and provides [annotations](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts/tree/master/screencast-annotations) for us to grasp at once what the screencast is about, and what the main steps of the analyses are (including the main `R` functions he used).     

Check out David Robinson's talk [Ten Tremendous Tricks for Tidyverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDHSBUN_rVU). You might also be interested in Emily Robinson's talk [The Lesser Known Stars of the Tidyverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax4LXQ5t38k)

OK, enough blabla, let's get to it.
